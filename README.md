# Natural Language Processing: Text Embeddings and Semantic Analysis

This notebook demonstrates fundamental NLP techniques for representing and analyzing text data using modern embedding approaches.

## What's in this Notebook?

### 1. Semantic Search with GloVe Embeddings
In the first exercise, we build a simple semantic search engine using GloVe word embeddings. This demonstrates:
- How to represent documents as vectors by averaging word embeddings
- Computing semantic similarity between texts using cosine similarity
- Implementing a basic retrieval system that understands meaning, not just keywords

### 2. Tweet Visualization with Transformer Embeddings
In the second exercise, we visualize tweet embeddings in 2D space using:
- State-of-the-art transformer models to generate high-quality text embeddings
- Dimensionality reduction with PCA to visualize high-dimensional data
- Techniques for exploring patterns and clusters in text data

## Key Concepts

**Word/Sentence Embeddings**: Numerical representations of text that capture semantic meaning in a vector space. Similar texts have similar vectors.

**Semantic Search**: Finding documents based on meaning rather than exact keyword matching.

**Dimensionality Reduction**: Techniques to reduce high-dimensional data (like embeddings) to lower dimensions while preserving important relationships.

**Cosine Similarity**: A measure of similarity between two non-zero vectors, commonly used to compare document embeddings.

These exercises demonstrate how modern NLP techniques can transform unstructured text into structured representations that machines can process to understand meaning.
